Results:
1. I have setup the ssh public key in my IU Github account.
2. I created the private repository in Github c355-submissions and added a sample readme and descripton for it.
3. Though I have previous exprience in Unix, I went through the manual and was able to find a few things which I did not know before. The 'apropos' and how to make a process run in background were some the new things I could learn.
4. I have setup the local repo in my system and setup Emacs. Since I have used emacs in my previous courses, I am used to it. I have added packages to work for C.
5. I created the sample hello world program hello.c and was able to run it both locally and in a Linux server. To print the Hello World text, I echo'ed "Hello World" using the system() function. I was able to background the process and kill it as well.
6. I have come up with multiple options to implement a ridiculous "Hello World" program. Initially, I planned to open an random man page and present it to user and annoy him with it. But since the output is always expected to be "Hello World" and a 3 second sleep, I chose to create new processes in backend. I made it better by compiling the same program and running itself after. This caused an exponenetial growth in "Hello World" printed and hence I used the "wait()" command to stop the parent program. This was we still maintian the 3 second sleep time and still make an annoying program which will screw up with the system. Please close the program immediately after running it to keep the the system safe.
7. Finally I brushed up my git skills and got comfortable with it. I use magit with emacs which is a git package in emacs and we can use this to checkin code to git directly from emacs. I was able to use git log, commit, add, push, pull, clone, init etc.
